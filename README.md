Project: Look Creator

The purpose of this project is to help a user get dressed by giving them outfit ideas based on an activity (provided by the user) and the weather (API call).

Initial Thoughts
    * A user will add clothing items from their closet to their wardrobe
    * A user enters all the activites they participate
    * For each activity a user will create look scripts for each look they associate with a given activity
    * The user will provide an activity each time they want to create an outfit
    * The algorithm will pick a look script and then search the wardrobe for an outfit
    * The algorithm will pick based on least use
